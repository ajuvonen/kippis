# kippis

This is a small cocktail search application built on top of The Cocktail DB. The application uses an API key meant for testing purposes only, and as such is not production ready. You can use the application to search for cocktails by their main ingredient, or with a text search. Add the cocktails to your cart and proceed to get a list of all ingredients you need to acquire.

The project was created with Vue3, TypeScript, and Vite. Used libraries include Pinia and TailwindCSS. Testing is done with Vitest and Mock Service Worker. For CI, the project uses Github Actions.
